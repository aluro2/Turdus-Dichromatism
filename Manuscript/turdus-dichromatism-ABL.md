# Abstract

 Ecological conditions limiting the time to find a compatible mate or increasing the difficulty in
 doing so likely promote the evolution of traits used for species and mate recognition. Here, we
 tested this species recognition hypothesis for promoting plumage sexual dichromatism in the true thrushes
 (_Turdus_), a large and diverse genus of passerine birds. We used receptor-noise limited models of
 avian vision to quantify avian-perceived chromatic and achromatic visual contrasts between male and
 female plumage patches and tested the influence of breeding timing, spacing, and sympatry with
 other _Turdus_ species on plumage dimorphism. As predicted, we found that 1) true thrush species with
 migratory
 behaviour have greater plumage sexual dimorphism than non-migratory species, 2) species with longer
 breeding seasons have less sexual dichromatism, and 3) the number of _Turdus_ thrush species
 breeding in sympatry is associated with more plumage dimorphism. These results suggest that
 conspecific recognition systems, including species and mate recognition, play a prominent role in the
 evolution of thrush plumage sexual dimorphism.

# Introduction

   Species recognition is necessary in sexually reproducing lineages for
   individuals to find compatible mates and produce viable offspring
   [@andersson1994;@groning2008]. Conspicuous traits signaling
   species and sex identity increase the ease and speed of species recognition by reducing the
   effort, error, and time involved when searching
   for compatible mates and lessen the likelihood of mating with heterospecifics
   [@pfennig2012]. Traits used in species and
   mate recognition may also serve as signals of status to conspecifics and
   reduce costly conflicts over resources and mates [@west-eberhard1983]. Accordingly, distinct
   traits facilitating species-specific recognition and signaling breeding status should be more likely to arise and be maintained
   under conditions that increase both the difficulty of finding a compatible mate and degree of resource
   competition among conspecifics and closely-related species. Conditions likely to favour traits
   signaling individuals' species and breeding status include high sympatry with many
   closely-related species, limited time to find a compatible breeding mates, and low rates of encounter
   with potential breeding mates [@andersson1994].

   In birds, plumage colour is a highly conspicuous trait signaling
   species and (often) sex identity [@martin2015a;@bitton2016].
   Plumage sexual dichromatism, or the distinct set of differences in the appearance
   of male and female feather colours, is common in birds and is usually
   attributed to different natural and sexual selection pressures on males and females
   [@martin1996;@burns1998;@badyaev2003;@dale2015;@dunn2015]. Plumage sexual dichromatism results in a visibly perceivable trait useful for recognizing
   an individual's species, sex, and (sometimes) age (e.g., in species with sex-specific delayed plumage
   maturation, see @hawkins2012), reducing the time and effort necessary to
   identify a suitable mate [@hamilton1961;@saetre1992]. Evidence in favour of this recognition
   hypothesis for sexual dichromatism includes a positive association of greater plumage sexual
   dichromatism with migratory behaviour and
   shorter breeding seasons [@badyaev2003]. Avian
   species that migrate to and from their breeding
   territories, reside on mainland continents, and have large geographic ranges tend to have greater plumage
   sexual dichromatism and plumage colour elaboration than species that do not migrate, reside on islands, and have limited breeding ranges
   [@friedman2009;@dale2015;@simpson2015a;@matysiokova2017;@badyaev1998;@figuerola2000;@tobias2009;@roulin2010;@doutrelant2016;@kearns2020].

   Moreover, plumage sexual dichromatism likely plays a role in hybridization
   avoidance via reproductive character displacement to facilitate species and mate recognition,
   especially among closely-related species. For example, in European _Ficedula_ flycatchers, female choice
   selects for divergent male plumage colouration across populations and species, leading to character
   displacement and reduced rates of interspecific
   hybridization [@alatalo1994;@saetre1997;@laaksonen2015]. More broadly and across taxa, greater plumage
   dichromatism is positively correlated with transitions from allopatry to
   parapatry and increases in geographic range overlaps among
   passerine sister species pairs [@cooney2017]. Greater plumage sexual
   dichromatism has also been found to be associated with greater species divergence and richness
   [@seddon2013;@cooney2019].
   Among passerine sister species pairs, more pronounced changes in male rather than female plumage
   colouration in sexually-dichromatic species suggest that female choice and male-male
   competition often lead to concurrent increases in sexual dichromatism and speciation events [@seddon2013]. Therefore, plumage sexual dichromatism may be a selected trait for facilitating species and mate recognition when
   closely-related species have sympatric breeding ranges [@martin2010;@martin2015a].

   True thrushes (genus: _Turdus_) are an exceptionally
   diverse genus of passerine birds consisting of about ~86 species distributed across the globe
   (Fig. 1). The true thrushes are an ideal passerine clade for examining the species recognition hypothesis for plumage sexual dimorphism. Plumage sexual dimorphism and migratory behaviours vary substantially between species
   and sexual dichromatism has evolved multiple times in thrushes across the world
   [@clement2000;@nagy2019]. Hybridization also occurs in some, but not all, _Turdus_ species. There is a large hybrid zone between four _Turdus_ species (_T. atrogularis_, _T. eunomus_,
   _T. naumanni_, _T. ruficollis_) in north-central Asia [@mccarthy2006], indicating that some
   sympatric _Turdus_ species successfully interbreed.

   Overall, ecological conditions that increase the time and degree of difficulty in finding a
   suitable conspecific mate should select for phenotypic traits that reliably signal species and
   sex identity. Across various bird lineages, greater plumage dichromatism is present in species that
   are i) migratory rather than nonmigratory, ii) have shorter breeding seasons, iii) live on
   mainlands rather than islands, iv) have larger breeding ranges (distributions), and v) breed in
   sympatry with more
   closely-related species. These patterns suggest that circumstances where rapid species recognition is
   challenging strongly favour the evolution and maintenance of prominent plumage sexual
   dichromatism in birds. Here, we test these predictions of the species recognition hypothesis for
   sexually-dimorphic avian plumage by evaluating the potential influences of breeding timing, spacing, and
   sympatry on plumage dichromatism in the _Turdus_ thrushes.

# Methods

Initial pre-registration of the study's methods and analyses are available on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/zum6d).

## *Plumage sexual dichromatism*

A total of N=77 *Turdus* thrush species (approximately ~89% of all known true thrush species) were sampled for plumage spectral
reflectance using prepared bird skin specimens at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York City and the Field Museum in Chicago. Reflectance measurements spanning
300-700nm were taken in triplicate from the belly, breast, throat, crown, and
mantle plumage patches [@andersson2006] of each individual. N=3 male and N=3 female individuals were measured for most species
(exceptions: *T. lawrencii*, N=2 males and N=2 females; *T. swalesi*,
N=1 male and N=1 female). Reflectance spectra were measured using a 400 μm fiber
optic reflection probe fitted with a rubber stopper to maintain a consistent
measuring distance of 3 mm and area of 2 mm<sup>2</sup> at a 90° angle to the
surface of the feather patch. Measurements were taken using a JAZ spectrometer
with a pulsed-xenon light source (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, USA) and we used a diffuse 99% reflectance white standard
(Spectralon WS-1-SL, Labsphere, North Sutton NH, USA).

We applied a receptor-noise limited visual model
[@vorobyev1998] of the European Blackbird (*T. merula*) visual system [@hart2000] in the *pavo*
[@maia2019, p. 2]⁠ package in R v4.0.0
[@rcoreteam2020]⁠ to calculate avian-perceived
chromatic and achromatic visual contrast (in units of “Just-Noticeable
Differences”,or JNDs) of male vs. female plumage patches for all sampled
*Turdus* species. Chromatic and achromatic JNDs were calculated for male-female
pairs within each species (i.e., N=9 JND values calculated per patch for each
species where N=3 males and N=3 females sampled), and then JND values were
averaged for each species’ respective plumage patches. Under ideal laboratory
conditions, 1 JND is generally considered to be the discriminable
threshold past which an observer is predicted to be able to perceive the two
colours as different. However, natural light environments vary both spatially and
temporally [@endler1993]⁠, bringing into question the accuracy
of a 1 JND threshold for generalizing visual contrast under natural conditions.
Therefore, we calculated the total number of sexually-dichromatic plumage
patches per species (out of N=5 measured patches) as the number of plumage
patches with average JND values > 1, 2, or 3 to account for uncertainty in
visual discrimination thresholds due to variation in psychophysical and ambient
lighting conditions affecting the strength of between-sex plumage visual
contrast [@kemp2015]⁠. Additionally, we modeled the number of divergent plumage patches (JND >1, 2, and 3)  within sexes and between different sympatric species under different levels of breeding range overlap (10% increments between 0-90%).

## *Life History Data*

### *Breeding Timing Model*

We collected data on migration behaviour and breeding season length from
*Thrushes* [@clement2000] and the *Handbook of the Birds of the World*
[@delhoyo2017]⁠. We assigned three different kinds of
migratory behaviour: 1) *full migration* when a species description clearly
stated that a species "migrates", 2) *partial migration* when a species was
described to have "altitudinal migration", "latitudinal migration" or "movement
during non-breeding season", or 3) *sedentary* when a species was described
as "resident" or "sedentary". Breeding season length was defined as the number
of months the species breeds each year.

### *Breeding Sympatry Model*

Species’ breeding ranges were acquired from *BirdLife International*
[@birdlifeinternationalandhandbookofthebirdsoftheworld2018]⁠.
We calculated congener breeding range overlaps (as percentages) using the
*letsR* package in R [@vilela2015]⁠. We then calculated the
number of sympatric species as the number of congeners with breeding ranges that
overlap >30% with the focal species’ breeding range
[@cooney2017]. Comparisons of the number of sexually-dimorphic plumage patches vs. the number of sympatric species among different breeding range overlap thresholds are provided in Supplementary Figure 2.

### *Breeding Spacing Model*

Species’ breeding range sizes (in km<sup>2</sup>) were acquired using the
*BirdLife International* breeding range maps. Species’ island vs. mainland
residence was also determined using breeding ranges from *BirdLife
International*. Mainland residence was assigned if the species had a breeding
range on any continent and Japan. Island residence was assigned to species
having a breeding range limited to a non-continental landmass entirely
surrounded by an oceanic body of water.

## *Statistical modeling*

We used phylogenetically-corrected Bayesian multilevel logistic regression
models using the *brms* v2.13.0 package [@burkner2017] in R
v4.0.0 [@rcoreteam2020]⁠. We modeled plumage sexual dimorphism responses as the
number of sexually-dichromatic patches >1, 2, and 3 chromatic and achromatic
JNDs. Plumage dimorphism responses were modelled as binomial trials (N=5 plumage patch “trials”) to test for
associations with breeding timing, breeding sympatry and breeding spacing. For
all phylogenetically-corrected models, we used the *Turdus* phylogeny from
Nylander et al. (2008) [@nylander2008] to create
a covariance matrix of species’ phylogenetic relationships. All models used a
dataset of N=67 out of the *Turdus* species for which all the types of data (see above) were available.

Our *breeding timing* models included the following predictors: z-scores of
breeding season length (mean-centered by $\mu$ = 5.4 months, and scaled by one standard deviation $\sigma$ = 2.3 months),
migratory behaviour (no migration as the reference category versus partial
or full migration), and their interaction. *Breeding sympatry* models
included the number of sympatric species with greater than 30% breeding range
overlap as the only predictor of the probability of having a sexually-dichromatic plumage
patch. *Breeding spacing* models included $log_{e}$ transformed breeding
range size (km<sup>2</sup>) and breeding landmass (mainland as the reference
category versus island). We also ran null models (intercept only) for all
responses. All models’ intercepts and response standard deviations were assigned
a weakly informative prior (Student T: df = 3, location = 0, scale = 10) [@gelman2013], and predictor
coefficients were assigned flat uninformative priors. We ran each model for 6,000 iterations
across 6 chains and assessed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence using
the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic (Rhat) [@gelman2013]. We then
performed k-fold cross-validation [@vehtari2017] to refit
each model *K*=16 times. For each k-fold, the training dataset included a
randomly selected set of $N- N\frac{1}{K}$ or N≈63 species, and the
testing dataset included $N\frac{1}{K}$ or N≈4 species not included in the
training dataset. Finally, we compared differences between the models’ expected
log pointwise predictive densities (ELPD) to assess which model(s) best
predicted the probability of having a sexually-dichromatic plumage patch.
[@vehtari2017]⁠.

Models' predictor effects were assessed using 90% highest-density intervals of the posterior distributions and probability of direction, the proportion of the posterior distribution that shares the same sign (positive or negative) as the posterior median [@makowski2019], to provide estimates of the probability of that a predictor has an entirely positive or negative effect on the presence of sexually-dimorphic plumage patches. We assume predictor estimates with a probability of direction ≥ 0.90 to be 
indicative of a true existence of a predictor's effect on sexually-dimorphic plumage patches [@makowski2019].

# Results

## *Avian visual modeling*

Among N=77 _Turdus_  species, the following proportion have sexually monomorphic plumage (combined
achromatic and chromatic JND thresholds): 1.3% (n=1 species) have no sexually-dimorphic patches > 1
JND , 44% (n=34 species) have no dimorphic patches > 2 JND, and 63% (n=49 species) have no dimorphic
patches > 3 JND (Table S1). Additional proportions of _Turdus_ species with sexually-dimorphic
achromatic or chromatic plumage patches are available in Table S2. When comparing within sexes
between sympatric species (i.e., at least a 30% overlap in breeding ranges: n=39 species with at least one sympatric species and a median of n=6 sympatric species per focal species), the median
number of avian-discriminable plumage patches between species is 1 or greater for all achromatic and
chromatic JND thresholds of JND > 1, > 2 and > 3 except for sympatric females at a chromatic JND threshold > 3 (Fig. S1).

## *Model comparisons*
_Breeding sympatry_, _breeding timing_, and _breeding spacing_ performed considerably better than
_intercept-only_ (null models) in predicting the probability of a species
having a sexually-dimorphic plumage patch. We obtained N ≥ 4000 effective posterior samples for each model parameter and all models’
Markov Chains (MCMC) successfully converged (Rhat = 1 for all models’
parameters) (Supplementary Figure 3, 4). All _breeding sympatry_, _breeding timing_, and _breeding spacing_ models performed similarly well and substantially better than _intercept only_ models in predicting the probability of having a sexually-dimorphic plumage patch with achromatic JND values > 1, 2, or 3 (Table 1; all models predicting achromatic plumage patches had ELPD values within 4, following the convention of @burnham2002).  Among models predicting the probability of having a  sexually-dichromatic plumage patch with chromatic JND values >1, 2, or 3, all _breeding sympatry_, _breeding timing_, and _breeding spacing_ models performed much better than _intercept only_ models, and _breeding sympatry_ models had the top predictive performance (Table 1; _breeding sympatry_ models all have ELPD =0, only the _breeding spacing_ models predicting dichromatic plumage patches had similar predictive performance).

## *Achromatic plumage sexual dimorphism predictors*

Migratory behaviour and shorter breeding season lengths were strongly associated with greater odds
of a species having achromatic plumage sexual dimorphism. All model predictors' effect estimates are provided as the posterior median odds-ratio (OR) and
90% highest-density interval (HDI) in Table 2. Among predictors of achromatic sexually-dimorphic
plumage patches, only predictors included in the _breeding timing_ model have predictors with
probability of direction (_pd_) values ≥ 0.90 (Table 2). Specifically, longer breeding season length
was associated with lower odds of a species having a sexually-dimorphic plumage patch with
achromatic JND > 2 (breeding season length, OR [90% HDI] = 0.10 [0.01, 1.1], 89.5% decrease in odds
per 2.3-month increase in breeding season) and JND > 3 (breeding season length, OR [90% HDI] = 0.25
[0.03, 1.5], 75% decrease in odds per 2.3-month increase in breeding season). Additionally, full
migratory behaviour, rather than no migratory behaviour, was associated with greater odds of a
species having a sexually-dimorphic plumage patch with achromatic JND > 1 (full migration, OR [90%
HDI] = 4.97 [0.95, 24.4]), JND > 2 (full migration, OR [90% HDI] = 66.5 [3.2, 1802.4]) and JND > 3
(OR [90% HDI] = 22.3 [1.6, 307.9]). Finally, both full and partial migratory behaviour, rather than
no migration behaviour, in conjunction with longer breeding season lengths are associated with
greater odds of a species having a sexually-dimorphic plumage patch with achromatic JND > 1
(breeding season length x full migration, OR [90% HDI]  = 4.84 [0.67, 39.6]), JND > 2 (breeding
season length x full migration, OR = 66.3 [0.59, 11415.7]; breeding season length x partial
migration, OR [90% HDI] = 20.7 [0.9, 589.1]) and JND > 3 (breeding season length x partial
migration, OR [90% HDI] = 8.28 [0.76, 109.1]).

## *Chromatic plumage sexual dimorphism predictors*
Migratory behaviour, shorter breeding season lengths, and a high number of sympatric _Turdus_ species were strongly associated with greater odds
of a species having chromatic plumage sexual dimorphism.
Among predictors of _breeding timing_ models predicting chromatic sexually-dimorphic plumage
patches, longer breeding season length was associated with lower odds of a species having a plumage
patch with chromatic JND > 2 (OR [90% HDI] = 0.14 [0.01, 1.42], 86% reduction in odds per 2.3 month
increase in breeding season). Both full and partial migratory behaviour rather than no migration are
associated with greater odds of a species having a plumage patch JND > 1 (partial migration, OR [90%
HDI] = 2.2 [0.94, 4.9]), JND > 2 (full migration, OR [90% HDI] = 80.51 [2.8, 3432.9]) and JND > 3
(partial migration, OR [90% HDI] = 71.2 [0.32, 59062.9]; full migration, OR [90% HDI] = 234.7 [
0.51, 300382.6]). For _breeding spacing models_, island residency rather than mainland residency was
associated with lower odds of having a plumage patch > 1 chromatic JND (island, OR [90% HDI] = 0.27
[0.09, 0.89]). Finally, more _Turdus_ species in sympatry was associated with higher odds of a
species having a sexually-dimorphic chromatic plumage patch with JND > 1 (number of sympatric
species, OR [90% HDI] = 1.4 [1.18, 1.67], 40% increase in odds per each additional sympatric
species), JND > 2 (sympatric species, OR [90% HDI] = 1.59 [1.01, 2.52], 59% increase in odds per
each additional sympatric species), and JND > 3 (sympatric species, OR [90% HDI] = 2.11 [1.03,
4.46], 111% increase in odds per each additional sympatric species).

# Discussion

Our results provide comparative correlative evidence in support of predictions of the species
recognition hypothesis for plumage sexual dimorphism in true thrushes. We used a receptor-noise
limited model of _Turdus merula_ vision [@vorobyev1998;@hart2000] to measure avian-perceivable
visual contrast of plumage colours and found that the odds of plumage sexual dimorphism are much
greater for _Turdus_ thrush species that have full or partial migration rather than no migration,
have relatively short breeding seasons, and are in sympatry with many other true thrush species
(Table 1,2). Our results align with prior comparative studies of avian plumage sexual dimorphism where
strong associations of sexual dichromatism with greater migratory behaviour [@dale2015] and more
sympatric taxa [@cooney2017] were found
among many species of different passerine families.

 Further, we determined that sympatric _Turdus_ species have distinguishable plumage colouration
 differences from one another when measuring plumage appearance from the avian visual perspective
 (Fig. S1). Divergent plumage colouration within sexes between closely-related species indicates that plumage sexual dichromatism may have evolved to facilitate species
and mate recognition in _Turdus_ species breeding under higher sympatry with other true thrushes. However, we cannot
 directly determine if the plumage sexual dimorphism in sympatric _Turdus_ species is the result of
 reproductive character displacement. We do not know if past changes in species' plumage
 sexual dimorphism occurred before or during periods of sympatry with other _Turdus_ species.
 Regardless, present-day plumage sexual dimorphism and perceivable differences in plumage
 colouration between sympatric species likely reduces the challenge of finding compatible mates by
 signaling an individual's sex, breeding status, and species. For example, the four species _Turdus_ hybrid zone
 in north-central Asia [@mccarthy2006] is a particularly striking example where repoductive character
 displacement has likely occurred. All four species exhibit strong plumage sexual
 dimorphism (Figure S2). Comparing within sexes between sister species pairs of _T.ruficollis_ and _T.atrogularis_, and
 _T.naumanni_ and _T.eunomus_ [@nylander2008], plumage patterns of the species pairs are nearly identical
 except for a divergence in colour. _T.ruficollis_ and _T.atrogularis_ share similar facial and
 throat colouring patterns, with the main difference being red colouration in _T.ruficollis_ in
 opposition to the black colouration of _T.atrogularis_. In the second species pair, _T.naumanni_
 has red ventral plumage colouration and _T.eunomus_ has black ventral plumage colouration.

 Previous studies have found that closely-related sympatric species tend to have more similar
 plumage appearance than expected if plumage colouration patterns had evolved to facilitate species
 recognition via reproductive character displacement [@simpson2021;@miller2019]. The potential lack
 of major plumage colour divergence among closely-related sympatric species may be attributable to
 constraints imposed by a shared light environment on colour signal efficiency [@mcnaught2002], or
 similar natural selection pressures (e.g., predators, parasites, and weather). Generally, despite
 greater similarity in plumage appearance in comparison to allopatric species, closely-related
 sympatric species can still have substantially different and biologically-relevant differences in
 achromatic or chromatic interspecific visual contrast of plumage patches when measuring plumage
 colouration differences from the avian visual perspective (as we have found in our analyses).

# Conclusions

Patterns of plumage sexual dimorphism in true thrushes (_Turdus_) are consistent with select predictions of
the species recognition hypothesis for plumage sexual dimorphism. Migratory behaviour and limited
breeding seasons reduce the amount of time available to find a mate, and greater plumage sexual
dimorphism may help migratory species find compatible mates more rapidly. Greater plumage sexual
dimorphism in _Turdus_ species under sympatry with other true thrush species also supports the
possibility that increased plumage sexual dichromatism may be the result of reproductive character
displacement. Therefore, greater plumage sexual dimorphism likely reduces species recognition errors and hybridization.
